  |===
    | Status code | Usage

    | `200 OK`
    | Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
    | The actual response will depend on the request method used.
    | In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
    | In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

    | `201 Created`
    | The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

    | `204 No Content`
    | The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

    | `400 Bad Request`
    | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

    | `404 Not Found`
    | The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
